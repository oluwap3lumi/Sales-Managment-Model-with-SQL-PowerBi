# Sales-Managment-Model-with-SQL-PowerBi
The project idea was to make an executive sales management dashboard & report for a sales manager or a business manager. A user story was defined to fulfil delivery and ensure that the data acceptance criteria was maintained throughout the project. 
Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL): To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories, data cleaning & transformation was performed in SQL. 
The finished sales management dashboard, page 1 works as a dashboard and overview, with the other pages focused on combining tables for necessary details and visualizations to show sales over time, per customers and per products. I could not publish the PowerBi dashboard online becasue i use a free versionðŸ™ƒ.
